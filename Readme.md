# Rocket.Chat iOS App Integration Guide

To implement the features of the Rocket.Chat iOS app into your SwiftUI project, you will need to integrate a range of functionalities including real-time chat, user management, theming, and more. Here’s a breakdown of the key features and how you might implement them:

## Key Features

### Real-Time Chat:
- Implement real-time messaging using WebSockets. Apple's `URLSessionWebSocketTask` can be used for this.
- Use Combine or async/await for handling asynchronous message updates.

### User Authentication:
- Support various authentication methods such as OAuth (GitHub, Google, etc.).
- Use `ASWebAuthenticationSession` for OAuth flows.

### User Management:
- Implement user profile screens to display user details like name, status, roles, and timezone.
- Use SwiftUI views for profile display and editing.

### Chat Rooms and Channels:
- Create chat rooms and channels with options to manage members.
- Use `List` and `NavigationView` for navigation between different chat rooms.

### Message Formatting:
- Support markdown in messages for formatting text.
- Use a markdown parser to render messages within SwiftUI views.

### File Sharing:
- Allow users to share files within the chat.
- Use `PHPickerViewController` for selecting and uploading files.

### Notifications:
- Implement push notifications using `UNUserNotificationCenter`.
- Handle in-app notifications for real-time message alerts.

### Theming:
- Provide light, dark, and black themes.
- Use SwiftUI’s `@Environment` to dynamically change themes.

### Offline Support:
- Cache messages locally and synchronize them when the network is available.
- Use CoreData or SQLite for local storage.

### Quick Actions:
- Implement 3D touch or long-press actions for quick access to chat rooms.
- Use `UIApplicationShortcutItem` for home screen quick actions.
